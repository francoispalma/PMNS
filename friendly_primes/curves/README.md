# Curves constructed on PMNS-friendly primes
This subdirectory contains example of Elliptic curves generated from some randomly generated primes belonging to the PMNS-friendly class.

They are arranged in python dictionaries for ease of use.

The format used is curvedict[prime] = [b, trace, embedded degree].

All curves are of prime order using the short weierstrass equation with a = -3.
