# Under Construction
Edit the values at the top of the "genmppmns.py" file before launching it for generation. Later it will be done with parameters and options.

Once a PMNS is found, edit the values in "mpprecalcs.py" and launch it to generate the corresponding "mpparams.h" file needed.

Then, simply run "make" to launch a benchmark and validation code.

The validation will be done according to the values in "mpprecalcs.py".

Note : To run PMNS or code generation, the SageMath library is needed. It can be found here: http://www.sagemath.org/
