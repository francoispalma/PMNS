# PMNS

This project is an implementation of the Polynomial Modular Number System (PMNS), a system for fast modular arithmetic operations for use in cryptography.

The main branch is currently being updated.

The "guided tour" folder contains all the code necessary to recreate the tables in "PMNS for cryptography: a guided tour".

The implementation is in C with utility functions in Python for generation purposes.
